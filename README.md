### First Session:

Dedicated to showcasing AI tools that can support your studies, both in this course and beyond. These tools will enhance your academic experience and contribute to your future professional success.

### Second Session:

Dedicated to reading and note-taking. During this time, you will either turn off your technological devices or switch them to airplane mode to ensure focus for yourself and your peers.

### Third Session:

You will have two hours to finish your reading with your peers and respond to the following questions related to your weekly reading and/or assignment. Your response can include direct references or quotes from the reading. You don't need to be in the class for the reading and form.

**Example Questions:**

- What is the core question of this text?
- What is the most interesting or relevant idea for me?
- What are my three key takeaways?

While you are encouraged to use AI tools (including ones you are unfamiliar with), you cannot simply copy and paste from them—you must incorporate your ideas and words. In this session, we will start by covering AI tools and having short discussions on reading before moving on to the writing stage.
